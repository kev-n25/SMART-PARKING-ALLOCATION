# SMART-PARKING-ALLOCATION
ParkEQ is a web-based smart parking application that helps drivers identify vacant parking spaces and reduces congestion by modeling real human behavior using mathematics and game theory.

Instead of forcing drivers, ParkEQ shows how selfish parking decisions naturally settle into a stable state (Nash Equilibrium) and how smart incentives can improve overall efficiency.
