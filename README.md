Project Description:
    Our project models real life urban parking as strategic problem and uses the math model Nash Equilibrium to minimize congestion and travel cost. The system provides real-time, location-based parking recommendations through an interactive map interface.

The Concept:
    The project models urban parking as a strategic decision-making problem using game theory.Each driver is treated as a player who chooses a parking slot to minimize personal cost.A cost function is defined based on distance and congestion at each parking location.Nash equilibrium is used to recommend parking slots where no user benefits by switching alone.This prevents overcrowding of nearby slots and distributes vehicles more efficiently.Real-time location data and spatial distance calculations support dynamic recommendations.The approach demonstrates how mathematical modeling can solve real-world urban challenges.
